# orbit-dynamichud-stress
 A stress addon for Orbit Studios Dynamic Hud (qbx_hud stress system)

## Disclaimer
This stress system is only slightly adjusted to suit my HUD but I take no credit for it. All the credit goes to the great people at QBX.
This stress system is taken, adjusted and isolated from qbx_hud.
